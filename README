assuming you're in this directory, Ensembl_Plant_Dumper

- go to parent dir:

cd ..

- clone biothings.api

git clone https://github.com/biothings/biothings.api.git

(never modify any files in this repo, you shouldn't have to)

- install biothings.api dependencies, using pip:

cd biothings.api
pip install -r requirements.txt

(if some are missing, it's possible, report it to me, don't try to install
it in your repo, like you did with "asyncio", "asyncssh", etc...)

- go back to your app folder

cd ..
cd Ensembl_Plant_Dumper

- create a symlink so your app have access to biothings.api (see the chapter about imports in python)

ln -s ../biothings.api/biothings biothings

- run your script

python Plant_Dumper_first_draft.py

(you shouldn't have any error. It won't do much though, because the actual dump code is not active, you miss some code, we'll see that later!)
